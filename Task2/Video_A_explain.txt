a trend where retentin tends to decrease as the vidoe progresses.The first few positions generally have higher retention rates.

Position 1: As the introduction continues, retention may slighly drop but still remain high. I would estimate around 89.21% based on compariosn with other videos.

Position 2: Furthermore, as the first story begins, retention  might drop a bit more, but the engaging content should keep it relatively high I would predict 86.64% in comparison with other video scenarios

Position 4: As the video progresses, retention may continues to decline, but will still be above average due to the content.I would predict around 82.17% in comparison to other.
